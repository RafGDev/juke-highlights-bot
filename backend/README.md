# Juke Highlights

Juke Highlights is a bot that will download the most popular clips for a specific game, parses and
then concatenates them using ffmpeg until then getting uploaded to youtube. The project started out
as a command line application but then I decided to expose the command line utility as an API while
offering a nice and simple UI built with React.

## Use with docker

Just because of the amount of dependencies, I have decided to only offer a docker version. To run
the server, just run the command ``docker-compose up`` in the root directory. Then head to your
browser and visit ``localhost:8080``.

## Contribution

Will probably not work on this anymore but if anyone has any bugfixes that they've fixed, I will be
willing to accept PR's however no added features will be added.
